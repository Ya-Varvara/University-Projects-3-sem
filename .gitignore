# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config —global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
Laba_8/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
Laba_8/db/*.sqlite3
Laba_8/db/*.sqlite3-journal
Laba_8/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
Laba_8/log/*
Laba_8/tmp/*


# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
Laba_8/tmp/pids/*
!Laba_8/tmp/pids/

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
Laba_8/storage/*

Laba_8/public/assets
Laba_8/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
Laba_8/config/master.key
